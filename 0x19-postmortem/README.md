Postmortem: Outage on Web Stack Debugging Project
Issue Summary: Duration: June 10, 2023, 14:00 UTC - June 10, 2023, 18:00 UTC Impact: The web stack debugging project experienced a complete service outage, resulting in all users being unable to access the platform. Approximately 90% of users were affected.
Timeline:
•	14:00 UTC: The issue was detected when a monitoring alert indicated a sudden increase in error rates and a drop in incoming requests.
•	The engineering team investigated the issue, assuming it was related to a recent deployment.
•	Misleading investigation paths were taken, including examining the network infrastructure and database performance, which did not reveal any abnormalities.
•	The incident was escalated to the DevOps team and senior engineers for further analysis and resolution.
•	16:00 UTC: After extensive investigation, the root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to a bottleneck in request routing.
•	17:00 UTC: The incident was resolved by correcting the load balancer configuration and restarting the affected services.
Root Cause and Resolution: The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. The load balancer was not distributing incoming requests evenly across the backend servers, causing one server to handle the majority of the traffic while others remained underutilized. As a result, the overloaded server became a bottleneck, leading to degraded performance and eventually a complete outage.
To resolve the issue, the load balancer configuration was updated to evenly distribute incoming requests across all available backend servers. Additionally, the affected services were restarted to ensure a clean state and restore proper functionality.
Corrective and Preventative Measures: To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures will be implemented:
•	Regular load testing: Conduct load testing on the web stack to identify and address any potential performance bottlenecks or misconfigurations.
•	Automated monitoring: Implement automated monitoring systems to detect abnormal traffic patterns, error rates, and load distribution within the web stack.
•	Configuration management: Improve the process of managing and documenting configuration changes to avoid misconfigurations and ensure consistency across the infrastructure.
•	Incident response training: Provide additional training to the engineering and operations teams on incident response protocols and best practices, including effective debugging techniques and escalation procedures.
Tasks to address the issue:
1.	Update load balancer configuration to evenly distribute requests.
2.	Implement automated monitoring for abnormal traffic patterns.
3.	Conduct load testing on the web stack to identify potential bottlenecks.
4.	Enhance documentation on configuration changes and ensure proper version control.
5.	Organize incident response training sessions for the engineering and operations teams.
By implementing these measures and addressing the identified tasks, we aim to improve the stability and reliability of the web stack debugging project, ensuring uninterrupted service for our users.
